* Add alternate rendering support for OF labels when CG is not present
  (the original updateOFPickerLabels, written in perl, used
   banner(1) output.)
* Use consistent error numbers and a function to map err->string
* More/better/simpler examples in man page?
* support bless -info -device. Paths would be of the form
    finderinfo[0] => disk0s9:/System/Library/CoreServices
  use MK
* Add real error ranges
* Be defensive about validating arguments

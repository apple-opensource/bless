.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm bless
is used to set volume bootability characteristics for PowerPC-based
Macintoshes. It can also modify Open Firmware to select a different
device to boot off of.
.Nm bless
has 3 modes of execution: Folder Mode, Device Mode, and Info Mode.
Folder Mode allows you to select a folder on a mounted volume to act as the
.Do blessed Dc
system folder, and optionally update Open Firmware to boot from that volume.
Device Mode is normally only used to format and setup a volume for
the first time. Info Mode will print out the currently\-blessed folder(s)
of a volume, or if no mountpoint is specified, the volume that OF is set to boot from.
.Ss FOLDER MODE
Folder Mode has the following options:
.Bl -tag -width "xbootBlockFilexfile" -compact
.It Fl folder Ar directory
A blessed Mac OS X/Darwin system folder, containing a
.Pa BootX
secondary loader for New World machines.
.It Fl folder9 Ar directory
A Mac OS 9/Classic system folder. If both
.Fl folder
and
.Fl folder9
are given, preference can be given to boot into Mac OS 9
by also using the
.Fl use9
flag.
.It Fl mount Ar directory
In lieu of specifying folders to bless,
.Fl mount
can be given, and the pre\-existing blessed folders are used.
.It Fl bootinfo Ar file
Create a
.Pa BootX
file in the Mac OS X/Darwin system folder using
.Ar file
as a source.
.It Fl bootBlocks
Set the boot blocks on the volume. This is required for booting
Mac OS 9. Boot blocks can be retrieved from the
.Pa System
file in the blessed Mac OS 9 system folder, or can be specified more directly
using the
.Fl bootBlockFile
or
.Fl system
flags.
.It Fl bootBlockFile Ar file
Extract boot blocks from
.Pa file
\&. The first 1024 bytes are read from the data fork of that file.
.It Fl save9
Used if no
.Fl folder9
flag was given, but if the pre\-existing Mac OS 9 system folder
should be preserved.
.It Fl saveX
Used if no
.Fl folder
flag was given, but if the pre\-existing Mac OS X/Darwin system folder
should be preserved.
.It Fl use9
Used if both
.Fl folder
and
.Fl folder9
were given, but Mac OS 9 should be the default for the volume.
.It Fl system Ar file
Extract boot blocks from the
.Pa file
System file, using the Carbon resource manager. This will fail under Darwin,
where Carbon is not present.
.It Fl systemfile Ar file
Data fork System file to place in blessed System Folder
.It Fl label Ar name
Render a text label used in the OpenFirmware-based OS picker
.It Fl setOF
Set the
.Em boot-device
Open Firmware variable to boot off the volume containing
.Fl folder
\&.
.It Fl quiet
Do not print any output
.It Fl verbose
Print verbose output
.El
.Ss DEVICE MODE
Device Mode has the following options:
.Bl -tag -width "xbootBlockFilexfile" -compact
.It Fl device Ar device
Open the block device
.Ar device
\&. No volumes should be mounted from
.Ar device
\&.
.It Fl format Op Ar fstype
Format the device using the
.Ar fstype
filesystem, or if it is not given, default to
HFS+ with an HFS wrapper.
.It Fl fsargs Ar arg
Additional arguments to newfs for the given filesystem
.It Fl label Ar name
Give the filesystem the label
.Ar name
(in UTF-8 encoding)
.It Fl bootBlockFile Ar file
Extract boot blocks from
.Pa file
\&. The first 1024 bytes are read from the data fork of that file.
.It Fl mount Ar directory
Use
.Ar directory
as a temporary mount point for the HFS wrapper.
.It Fl wrapper Ar file
Mount the wrapper on
.Fl mount
and write
.Ar file
into the wrapper as the default System file.
.It Fl system Ar file
Override the
.Ar file
specifications for
.Fl bootBlockFile
and
.Fl wrapper
and use this file instead for both those functions.
.It Fl xcoff Ar file
Add the
.Ar file
as the HFS+ StartupFile, and update the partition map to
reflect it's location on disk. This is necessary for Old World
booting.
.It Fl setOF
Set the
.Em boot-device
Open Firmware variable to boot off the volume containing
.Fl folder
\&.
.It Fl quiet
Do not print any output
.It Fl verbose
Print verbose output
.El
.Ss INFO MODE
Info Mode has the following options:
.Bl -tag -width "xbootBlockFilexfile" -compact
.It Fl info Op Ar directory
Print out the blessed system folder for
.Ar directory
\&. If
.Ar directory
is not specified, print information for the current
.Em boot-device
(which may not necessarily be
.So
/
.Sc
\&.
.It Fl bootBlocks
Print out salient fields from the boot blocks of the volume.
.It Fl plist
Output all information in Property List (.plist) format, suitable
for parsing by CoreFoundation. This is most useful when
.Nm bless
is executed from another program and its standard output must be parsed.
.It Fl quiet
Do not print any output
.It Fl verbose
Print verbose output
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/standalong/ppc/bootx.bootinfo -compact
.It Pa /usr/standalone/ppc/bootx.xcoff
Secondary loader in XCOFF format, used with
.Fl xcoff
flag. Used for booting of Old World PPC-based Macintoshes
.It Pa /usr/standalong/ppc/bootx.bootinfo
Secondary loader with XML headers, used with
.Fl bootinfo
flag. Used for booting New World PPC-based Macintoshes
.It Pa /System/Library/CoreServices
Typical blessed folder for Mac OS X and Darwin
